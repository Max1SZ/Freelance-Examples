JavaScript Mini Projects Collection
Interactive Front-End Apps Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This repository contains three small but complete front-end projects, each built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
They demonstrate UI design, DOM manipulation, and responsive interactivity without any external libraries.

1. JavaScript Quiz Game

File: js_quiz.html

Overview

An interactive quiz that tests basic JavaScript knowledge.
It includes a progress bar, real-time feedback for correct and incorrect answers, and a final score display.
The project demonstrates the use of event listeners, DOM updates, and dynamic state management in a single-page app.

Features

Five multiple-choice questions

Immediate feedback after each answer

Progress bar indicating quiz completion

Final score and restart option

Fully functional in any browser, no dependencies

How to Use

Open js_quiz.html in a browser.

Select an answer for each question.

Click Next Question to continue.

At the end, view your score and restart the quiz if desired.

Technologies

HTML5 – Structure and layout

CSS3 – Gradient UI, layout styling, and animations

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Quiz logic, scoring, and interactivity

2. Weather Dashboard (Offline Version)

File: wthr_dshbrd.html

Overview

A clean and responsive weather dashboard that simulates real API data.
It allows users to enter a city name and displays the current weather, using local data to mimic API behavior.
This project focuses on error handling, data rendering, and user interface clarity.

Features

City input and search function

Dynamic weather display (temperature, humidity, wind, pressure)

Loading and error states for improved user experience

Simulated API response with pre-defined city data

Modern glass-style design with gradients and blur effects

How to Use

Open wthr_dshbrd.html in your browser.

Enter a city name (e.g., London, Paris, Tokyo, Sydney).

The app displays simulated weather details for that city.

Note: This demo uses local data and does not require an API key.

Technologies

HTML5 – Structure

CSS3 – Styling with gradients and blur effects

JavaScript – Input handling, data lookup, and DOM rendering

3. Interactive Todo List

File: intrc_list.html

Overview

A simple and elegant to-do list application where users can add, complete, and delete tasks in real time.
It demonstrates array manipulation, DOM updates, and clean event-driven logic.

Features

Add and remove tasks instantly

Mark tasks as completed with a single click

Interactive hover effects and transitions

Simple, memory-based storage (no backend)

Fully responsive and browser-ready

How to Use

Open intrc_list.html in your browser.

Type a new task and press Add or press Enter.

Click a task to mark it as completed.

Click Delete to remove it from the list.

Technologies

HTML5 – Semantic structure

CSS3 – Modern styling and transitions

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Event handling and rendering logic
