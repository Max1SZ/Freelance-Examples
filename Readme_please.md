Helpy is a webpage i initially made as a study method and "cheating" method for exams on my institute,
but i saw it's potential as some archive for all my knowledge and i want to add more of my notes soon. 

It's not nice looking since i didn't care about design but rather "efficiency"
but i'll add my new knowledge to the website soon.

What's in helpy(if i recall):
*Python, R, Prolog, SQL
R and Prolog were for mainly study purposes

NOTES: 
Add the rest of languages you are learning. 

Next:
html and css, JS, Java, Typescript, React
ASM 68K projs/romhacking
Ruby?
